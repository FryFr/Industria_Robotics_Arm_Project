# 6-DoF Robotic Arm with Gripper

## Final Project for Robotics Course

**Institution**: Universidad EAN  
**Professor**: Nikolay Prieto, Ph.D.  
**Due Date**: June 10th, 2024  

### Project Overview
This repository contains all the components of the final project for the Robotics course, which involves the design, simulation, and construction of a 4-DoF (Degrees-of-Freedom) robotic arm equipped with a gripper. The goal is to develop a robotic arm capable of catching an object at a known location using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). The project culminates in the 3D printing and real-world demonstration of the robot.

### Project Objectives
- Acquire hands-on experience with robotic arm kinematics and inverse kinematics.
- Utilize ROS2 for the simulation and control of the robotic arm.
- Design and simulate a grasping task within a virtual environment.
- Translate the virtual design into a 3D printable model.
- Construct and demonstrate a functioning robotic arm.
- Document the entire project through a comprehensive report.

### Repository Contents
- **ROS2 Simulation Code**: Source code for simulating the robotic arm and gripper in ROS2.
- **Inverse Kinematics Calculations**: Implementations using the robotics-toolbox library.
- **CAD Design Files**: STL and CAD files for 3D printing the robotic arm components.
- **Additional Resources**: Configuration files, scripts, and other materials used during the project.

- [MoveIt!2 Documentation](https://docs.progress.com/category/moveit-documentation)
- Online resources for 4-DoF robotic arm kinematics.

### Additional Notes
- Exploration of different design options for the robotic arm and gripper mechanism is encouraged.
- Collaboration is allowed, but each student must submit an individual report and repository.
- Document progress regularly and test the simulation often.
- Ensure safety precautions during 3D printing and assembly.
- The robot's base must be securely fixed to the ground.
