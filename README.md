# Industria_Robotics_Arm_Project
This repository contains all the components of the final project for the Robotics course, which involves the design, simulation, and construction of a 6-DoF (Degrees-of-Freedom) robotic arm equipped with a gripper. The goal is to develop a robotic arm capable of catching an object at a known location using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2).
